First check for the 'basenme' in the query string, this is for the purpose for viewing 
directories that are above our html directory. this will delete the command to move up directories
or the '../' parts of the query string. The attacker or user will not be allowed to go up directories
or search directories freely.

if the folder does not exist first user the 'is_dir' and 'file_exists' system commands. by doing this
the attacker cannot freely look for folders/files. Then locate the dot (.) in the query string if they
are trying to access hidden directories, the head will then be set to forbidden, denying access.
