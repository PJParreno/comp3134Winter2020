Observations
------------

Session is a great way to deal with all this attacks. Its always better to establish a session on a 
web page in order to tighten security and make sure no one is getting in when they are not suppose to
with the right configuration in the code.

Als csfr_forms.php was the most useful in validation because it makes sure everything is in order 
before entering the site - like estabishing the sesson in this form rather then the actual site.
